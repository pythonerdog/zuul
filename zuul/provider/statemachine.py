class Instance:

    This class is used by the State Machine Driver classes to
    represent a standardized version of a remote cloud instance.
    Implement this class in your driver, override the :py:meth:`load`
    method, and supply as many of the fields as possible.

    The following attributes are required:

    * ready: bool (whether the instance is ready)
    * deleted: bool (whether the instance is in a deleted state)
    * interface_ip: str
    * metadata: dict

    The following are optional:

    * public_ipv4: str
    * public_ipv6: str
    * private_ipv4: str
    * cloud: str
    * az: str
    * region: str
    * host_id: str
    * driver_data: any
    * slot: int

    And the following are even more optional (as they are usually
    already set from the image configuration):

    * username: str
    * python_path: str
    * shell_type: str
    * connection_port: str
    * connection_type: str
    * host_keys: [str]

    This is extremely optional, in fact, it's difficult to imagine
    that it's useful for anything other than the metastatic driver:

    * node_attributes: dict

    This could be an instance, a disk, a floating IP, or anything

    adapter can clean them up.

    The `type` attribute should be an alphanumeric string suitable for
    inclusion in a statsd metric name.

    The `metadata` attribute is a dictionary of key/value pairs
    initially supplied by the driver to the adapter when an instance
    or image was created.  This is used by the driver to detect leaked
    resources.  The adapter may add any other information to this
    instance for its own bookeeping (resource type, id, etc).

    The 'plural_metric_name' attribute is set in the constructor
    automatically; override this value if necessary.
