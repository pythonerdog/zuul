    The lifecycle of a global (not pipeline-specific) event is:

    * Serialized form of event added to ZK queue.

    * During queue processing, events are de-serialized and
      AbstractEvent subclasses are instantiated.  An EventAckRef is
      associated with the event instance in order to maintain the link
      to the serialized form.

    * When event processing is complete, the EventAckRef is used to
      delete the original event.  If the event requires a result
      (e.g., a management event that returns data) the result will be
      written to a pre-determined location.  A future can watch for
      the result to appear at that location.

    Pipeline specific events usually start out as global events, but
    upon processing, may be forwarded to pipeline-specific queues.  In
    these cases, the original event will be deleted as above, and a
    new, identical event will be created in the pipeline-specific
    queue.  If the event expects a result, no result will be written
    upon forwarding; the result will only be written when the
    forwarded event is processed.
