    The maximum combined stdout and stderr output from a single
    Ansible task has been limited to 1GiB.  In the unlikely event that
    an existing job legitimately exceeds this limit, a new executor
    configuration option, :attr:`executor.output_max_bytes`, has been
    provided to temporarily increase the limit.  This option is likely
    to be removed in a future version of Zuul.  To avoid this issue,
    Ansible tasks with large volumes of output should be adjusted to
    redirect that output to a file which is separately collected and
    processed.
