    Zuul now matches Gerrit's behavior when
    ``change.submitWholeTopic`` is set in Gerrit.

    When this setting is enabled in Gerrit and a change is submitted
    (merged), all changes with the same topic are submitted
    simultaneously.  Zuul will now query for changes which are set to
    be submitted together by Gerrit when enqueing them and treat them
    as if they are a set of circular dependencies.

    If the projects are not part of pipeline queues which are
    configured to allow circular dependencies, then Zuul will report
    failure on enqueue.  Be sure that the submitWholeTopic setting in
    Gerrit and the allow-circular-dependencies setting in Zuul match.

    This functionality requires an HTTP connection to Gerrit.  If only
    an SSH connection is available, then changes submitted together
    will be ignored.
