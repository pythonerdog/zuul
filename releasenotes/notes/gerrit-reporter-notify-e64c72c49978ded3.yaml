    The Gerrit driver now has an additional option,
    :attr:`pipeline.reporter.<gerrit reporter>.notify` which
    configures the notification handling of reviews as noted in the
    `Gerrit changes API Docs <https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/rest-api-changes.html#review-input>`_.
    used to suppress reporting job results as review comments.  Due to
    the configuration syntax for Gerrit reporters, the word "notify"
    may no longer be used as a review label.
