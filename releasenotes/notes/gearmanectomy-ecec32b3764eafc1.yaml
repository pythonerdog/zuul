    Zuul no longer uses gearman.  It is no longer required to run a
    Gearman server, and the Zuul scheduler no longer does so.  All
    gearman-related settings in zuul.conf files are now ignored and
    may be removed.

    Commands such as `zuul enqueue` which were previously executed via
    Gearman may still be used by creating an authentication token and
    adding a `webclient` section to zuul.conf.
