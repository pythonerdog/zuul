    Users upgrading from previous versions of zuul will need to run
    ``zuul delete-state`` to delete Zuul's ephemeral state from
    Zookeeper. The ephemeral state produced by older versions of zuul
    is not compatible with this release. This command should be run while
    all Zuul services are stopped to prevent writes to the Zookeeper
    database. More information on this command can be found in the
    documentation:
    https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/reference/client.html#delete-state
