    A significant SQL schema migration is included which requires
    extra care when upgrading.

    It is recommended to make a database backup before upgrading in
    case of problems.  It is also recommended to test the migration
    with a copy of the database in a development environment first in
    order to ascertain expected runtime and detect any data integrity
    problems early.

    Zuul is unable to operate as normal during the schema upgrade.
    The following procedure is recommended:

      * Perform a database backup
      * Stop all Zuul components
      * Start one scheduler and wait for it to complete the migration
        and initialization
      * Start the rest of Zuul

    If the migration fails and the backing database is PostgreSQL, the
    migration will be rolled back and Zuul may be restarted on the
    previous version.  If the backing database is MySQL, if the error
    happens early enough the migration may be rolled back (look for
    "Early error in schema migration, rolling back" in scheduler
    logs).  If an error happens late in the migration, manual
    intervention may be required.
