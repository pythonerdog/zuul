    The `cherry-pick` merge mode will now silently skip commits that have
    already been applied to the tree when cherry-picking, instead of failing
    with an error.

    The exception to this is if the source of the cherry-pick is an empty
    commit, in which case it is always kept.

    Skipping commits that have already been applied is important in a pipeline
    triggered by the Gerrit `change-merged` event (like the `deploy` pipeline),
    since the scheduler would previously try to cherry-pick the change on top
    of the commit that just merged and fail.
