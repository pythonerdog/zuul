    The restricted Ansible environment used for untrusted playbooks
    has been relaxed.

    Zuul previously attempted to restrict the actions of playbooks
    running in the untrusted execution context on the executor so that
    users would not be able to load custom Ansible plugins, execute
    code on the executor, or use certain functions of built-in Ansible
    modules.  This was done in an attempt to improve the security of
    the Zuul executor.  However, the approach has proved laborious,
    prone to error, and increasingly incompatible with newer versions
    of Ansible.

    Therefore it has been removed, and now playbooks within both the
    trusted and untrusted execution contexts have access to the full
    suite of Ansible modules.  See the :ref:`executor_security`
    section for information on caveats relating to executor security.
