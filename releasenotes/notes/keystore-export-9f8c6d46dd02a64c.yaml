    Zuul no longer reads or writes project private key files from the
    scheduler's filesystem.  In order to load existing keys into
    ZooKeeper, run version 4.6.0 of the scheduler at least once, if
    you haven't already.

    A new command ``zuul export-keys`` has been added to export the
    encrypted keys from ZooKeeper onto the filesystem for backup.
    Likewise, ``zuul import-keys`` will load a previously-exported
    backup into ZooKeeper.  It is recommended that you use these
    commands in system backup scripts.
