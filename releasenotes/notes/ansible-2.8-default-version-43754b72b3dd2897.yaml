upgrade:
  - |
    The default version of Ansible used by Zuul jobs has been changed to 2.8.
    See :attr:`job.ansible-version` for more information.
  - |
    As a result of switching to Ansible 2.8, it is possible for the
    ansible_python_interpreter version of your nodeset to change to 'auto'.
    This could result in your jobs now running under a different version of
    python than prior to this release. See :ref:`ansible-and-python-3` for
    additional info.
  - |
    Ansible 2.6 for Zuul jobs has been marked deprecated and will be removed in
    a future release.
