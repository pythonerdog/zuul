    Project secrets keys and SSH keys are now stored in Zookeeper. All private
    data will be encrypted at rest, which requires a new mandatory setting
    :attr:`keystore.password` in ``zuul.conf``.

    For backup purposes the secrets keys and SSH keys will still exist on the
    local filesystem of the scheduler as before.
upgrade:
  - |
    As project secrets keys and SSH keys are stored encrypted in Zookeeper the
    new :attr:`keystore.password` option in ``zuul.conf`` is
    required. Please add it to your configuration for both the scheduler and
    executor.
