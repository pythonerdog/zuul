deprecations:
  - |
    Regular expressions using Python syntax are deprecated in favor of
    RE2 syntax instead, for additional speed and safety.  Negative
    lookahead assertions may be replaced using the `negate` keyword.
    See :ref:`regex` for more information.

    If Zuul detects a regular expression using Python syntax that is not
    supported by RE2, it will register a configuration syntax warning.
    These may be viewed on the configuration errors page in the web
    interface.

    A future version of Zuul will remove Python regex support
    completely and these warnings will become errors.
