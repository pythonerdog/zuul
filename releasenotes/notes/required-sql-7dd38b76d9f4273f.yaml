    The components zuul-scheduler and zuul-web now require database
    configuration. There is now only one supported database connection. If
    multiple sql connections have been configured only the first one will be
    used.

deprecations:
  - |
    Defining database connections using sql connection is now
    deprecated. Refer to :ref:`database` how to configure the database now.
