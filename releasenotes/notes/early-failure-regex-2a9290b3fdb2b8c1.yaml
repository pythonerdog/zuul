    A new job configuration option, :attr:`job.failure-output`, has
    been added to allow users to specify regular expressions which,
    when seen in the streaming job output, will trigger the early
    failure detection in Zuul so that dependent pipeline gate resets
    may begin before the completion of a failed job.
