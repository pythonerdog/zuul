    Jobs may now specify an alternate scheme to use when preparing
    repositories in the workspace.  The default remains the same
    golang-style, but an alternate scheme called `flat` is now
    available.  See :attr:`job.workspace-scheme` for more details.

    The internal git repo caches maintained by the mergers and
    executors now use a new naming scheme in order to avoid
    collisions.  When existing executors and mergers are restarted,
    they will remove their git repo caches and re-clone repos using
    the new scheme.  Jobs may be slow to start until the caches are
    warmed again.
