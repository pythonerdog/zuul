upgrade:
  - The Gerrit driver will now perform query actions over HTTP if an
    HTTP password is configured.  In this situation, the SSH
    connection is now only used for receiving events.  The HTTP
    password is not required, but it is recommended since it provides
    more reporting options (including line comments).
