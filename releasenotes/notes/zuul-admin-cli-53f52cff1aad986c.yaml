deprecations:
  - |
    The zuul CLI is renamed `zuul-admin`. The `zuul` command will remain usable until a future version,
    then will be phased out. Likewise, tenant-scoped, workflow affecting commands such as autohold,
    enqueue, dequeue, promote are deprecated from the zuul-admin CLI and will be phased out in a
    future version. They can still be performed via the `zuul-client` CLI.
