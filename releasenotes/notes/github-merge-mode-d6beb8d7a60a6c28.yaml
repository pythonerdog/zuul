    Zuul's GitHub driver has updated the default merge mode to better align
    with GitHub's default behavior. This change requires Git 2.33.0 or newer
    unless you explicitly override Zuul's default merge mode for a project.
    Additionally, if you aren't overriding the merge mode then the merge
    algorithm chosen may change depending on your Git and GitHub versions.
    This is expected to provide more deterministic results.
