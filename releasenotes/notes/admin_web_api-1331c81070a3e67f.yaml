    Allow users to perform tenant-scoped, privileged actions either through
    zuul-web's REST API or zuul's client, based on the JWT standard. The users
    need a valid bearer token to perform such actions; the scope is set by matching
    conditions on tokens' claims; these conditions can be defined in zuul's tenant
    configuration file.
    Zuul supports token signing and validation using the HS256 or RS256 algorithms.
    External JWKS are also supported for token validation only.
    Current tenant-scoped actions are "autohold", "enqueue" and "dequeue".
