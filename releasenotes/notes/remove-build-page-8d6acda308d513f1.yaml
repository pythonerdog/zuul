    The following attributes are now ignored:

      * The ``report-build-page`` tenant configuration setting.
      * The ``success-url`` job attribute.
      * The ``failure-url`` job attribute.

    The URL of the build page is now always reported for every build.
    This is now also true for in-progress builds, which provides for a
    more consistent user experience.

    Since the build page is always reported as the URL, the success
    and failure URL job attributes are no longer useful, so this
    functionality has also been removed.

    Zuul's configuration syntax checker will continue to allow these
    settings for now (they are simply ignored) but this will be
    removed in version 5.0 and using them will be considered an error.

    To achieve a similar result, consider returning the URL as an
    artifact from the job via `zuul_return`.  This will cause a link
    to appear in the "Artifacts" section of the build page.
