    The Github driver can now report file comments via Github checks API.
    If a github reporter is configured to use the checks API, file comments
    provided via ``zuul_return`` will automatically be reported to the pull
    request in Github.

    For more details on how to provide file comments from Zuul, see the
    documentation of the :ref:`return_values`.
