    Under specific conditions Zuul could fail to properly update git
    repos causing it to fall back to testing master. If jobs were
    meant to run against commits other than current master this lead
    to testing the wrong commit. Zuul now correctly updates repos and
    should test the correct commit in all cases.

    Specifically this could happen if a new branch was created off a
    commit in an existing branch. Then the first proposed change to
    this new branch would be tested against master instead.
