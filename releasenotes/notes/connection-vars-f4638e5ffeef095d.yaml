    The following connection-related variables are no longer allowed
    to be set in job definitions, as they may be used to circumvent
    security measures:

      * ansible_connection
      * ansible_host
      * ansible_python_interpreter
      * ansible_shell_executable
      * ansible_user

    They may still be set using the corresponding settings in
    Nodepool.
