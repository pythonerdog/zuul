    The Zuul Executor has a new governor sensor that detects when the
    Executor is nearing the limit on new processes. Running Zuul jobs
    in the Executor requires a number of process including but not limited
    to: Bubblewrap, Ansible, SSH, and SSH Agent. This new governor sensor
    helps to avoid jobs failing due to an inability to fork one of these
    many processes. Instead the Executor will pause its efforts until it
    backs away from the process limit.
