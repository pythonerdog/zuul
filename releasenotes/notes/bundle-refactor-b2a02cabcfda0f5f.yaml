prelude: >
    This release includes a significant refactoring of the internal
    handling of circular dependencies.  This requires some changes for
    consumers of Zuul output (via some reporters or the REST API) and
    requires special care during upgrades.  In the case of a
    dependency cycle between changes, Zuul pipeline queue items will
    now represent multiple changes rather than a single change.  This
    allows for more intuitive behavior and information display as well
    as better handling of job deduplication.
upgrade:
  - |
    Zuul can not be upgraded to this version while running.  To upgrade:

      * Stop all Zuul components running the previous version
        (stopping Nodepool is optional).

      * On a scheduler machine or image (with the scheduler stopped)
        and the new version of Zuul, run the command:

          zuul-admin delete-state --keep-config-cache

        This will delete all of the pipeline state from ZooKeeper, but
        it will retain the configuration cache (which contains all of
        the project configuration from zuul.yaml files).  This will
        speed up the startup process.

      * Start all Zuul components on the new version.
  - The MQTT reporter now includes a job_uuid field to correlate retry
    builds with final builds.
deprecations:
  - |
    The syntax of string substitution in pipeline reporter messages
    has changed.  Since queue items may now represent more than one
    change, the `{change}` substitution in messages is deprecated and
    will be removed in a future version.  To maintain backwards
    compatability, it currently refers to the arbitrary first change
    in the list of changes for a queue item.  Please upgrade your
    usage to use the new `{changes}` substitution which is a list.

    The syntax of string substitution in SMTP reporter messages
    has changed.  Since queue items may now represent more than one
    change, the `{change}` substitution in messages is deprecated and
    will be removed in a future version.  To maintain backwards
    compatability, it currently refers to the arbitrary first change
    in the list of changes for a queue item.  Please upgrade your
    usage to use the new `{changes}` substitution which is a list.
  - |
    The MQTT and Elasticsearch reporters now include a `changes` field
    which is a list of dictionaries representing the changes included
    in an item.  The correspending scalar fields describing what was
    previously the only change associated with an item remain for
    backwards compatability and refer to the arbitrary first change is
    the list of changes for a queue item.  These scalar values will be
    removed in a future version of Zuul.  Please upgrade yur usage to
    use the new `changes` entries.
  - |
    The `zuul.bundle_id` variable is deprecated and will be removed in
    a future version.  For backwards compatability, it currently
    duplicates the item uuid.
