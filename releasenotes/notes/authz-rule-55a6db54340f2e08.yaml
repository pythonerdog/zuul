    In preparation for expanded access control features in the web
    interface, and REST API, the ``admin-rule`` tenant configuration
    object has been renamed to ``authorization-rule``.  When applied
    to a tenant, the tenant attribute is still ``admin-rules`` since
    it determines admin access to that tenant.  This change will allow
    similar rules to be applied to non-admin level access in the
    future.

    Tenant configs should now follow this example:

    .. code-block:: yaml

       - authorization-rule:
           name: example-rule
       - tenant:
           name: example-tenant
           admin-rules:
             - example-rule

    The old form is still permitted for backwards compatability, but
    will be removed in a later version of Zuul.
