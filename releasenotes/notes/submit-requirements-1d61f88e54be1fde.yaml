    Zuul will now attempt to honor Gerrit "submit requirements" when
    determining whether to enqueue a change into a dependent (i.e.,
    "gate") pipeline.  Zuul previously honored only Gerrit's older
    "submit records" feature.  The new checks will avoid enqueing
    changes in "gate" pipelines in the cases where Zuul can
    unambiguously determine that there is no possibility of merging,
    but some non-mergable changes may still be enqueued if Zuul can
    not be certain whether a rule should apply or be disregarded (in
    these cases, Gerrit will fail to merge the change and Zuul will
    report the buildset as a MERGE_FAILURE).

    This requires Gerrit version 3.5.0 or later, and Zuul to be
    configured with HTTP access for Gerrit.
