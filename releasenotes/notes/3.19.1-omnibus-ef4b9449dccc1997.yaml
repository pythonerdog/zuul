    A long-standing security vulnerability regarding executing code on
    the executor was corrected.

    The Zuul executor was designed to prohibit executing command or
    shell tasks on the executor itself (i.e., localhost in Ansible)
    from untrusted playbooks.  Tobias Henkel discovered that this
    check has been broken for some time, likely since June of 2018.

    The use of bubblewrap means that any commands executed via this
    vulnerability would still be contained within the restricted
    environment, meaning that they can not access files outside of the
    build directory or continue running longer than the job.  However,
    by executing arbitrary commands, users may have been able to
    connect to unprotected internal network services.

    Because this bug is so long-standing, it is possible, even likely,
    that users may have accidentally come to rely on it.  We
    discovered two jobs in the zuul-jobs library which did so:
    dco-license and promote-docker-image.  The promote-docker-image
    job has been altered so it no longer needs to run a command on the
    executor.  The dco-license job has been altered to run on a node.
    If you would prefer to run it on the exceutor, you can create a
    new job in a config-project that uses the validate-dco-license
    role.

    You may want to look for other jobs in your system which may be
    affected by this.  To aid in that, we have created a script which
    will examine the job-output.json files created by previous builds
    and output any tasks it finds which are now (once again)
    prohibited.  This script is available here:

fixes:
  - |
    The dependency on kazoo has been upgraded to 2.8.0 which has an important
    fix for using Zookeeper over TLS.
  - |
    The Github access token URL has been updated in order to remove a
    deprecation warning.
