features:
  - |
    A new job attribute, `ansible-split-streams` has been added to
    instruct Zuul to keep stdout and stderr separate when running
    Ansible command tasks.
deprecations:
  - |
    Zuul is changing the behavior of its customized Ansible command
    module to match the standard Ansible behavior.
    
    The previous behavior and current default is to combine stdout and
    stderr streams.  In a later Zuul release, the
    `ansible-split-streams` default value will change from `false` to
    `true` in order to match the standard Ansible behavior and keep
    the streams separate.  A further Zuul release will remove the
    option altogether.
