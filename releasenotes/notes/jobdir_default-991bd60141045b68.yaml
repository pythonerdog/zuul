    The default value for the :attr:`executor.job_dir` configuration
    setting has been changed from ``/tmp`` to
    ``/var/lib/zuul/builds``.  It is important for
    :attr:`executor.job_dir` and :attr:`executor.git_dir` to be
    located on the same filesystem, so this change increases the chances
    that they end up on the same filesystem in most default configurations.

    The ``builds`` subdirectory will be created if it does not exist,
    however, ``/var/lib/zuul`` at least must exist and be writable by
    the Zuul user.
