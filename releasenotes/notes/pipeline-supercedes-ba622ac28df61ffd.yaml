    Pipelines may now indicate that they supercede other pipelines with the
    :attr:`pipeline.supercedes` attribute.

    When a change is enqueued in a pipeline which supercedes others,
    it will be removed from the other pipelines.  For example, a
    :term:`gate` pipeline may supercede a :term:`check` pipeline so
    that test resources are not spent running near-duplicate jobs
    simultaneously.
