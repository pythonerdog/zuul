    Zuul will execute bwrap with --disable-userns set if two conditions
    hold. 1) The version of bwrap is 0.8.0 or newer and 2) User namespaces
    are enabled in the zuul-executor runtime context. Doing so will
    prevent the zuul-executor bwrap runtimes from creating additional
    user namespaces which fortifies Zuul's security position.
