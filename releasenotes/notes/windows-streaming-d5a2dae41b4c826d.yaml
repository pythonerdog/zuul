    Live console log streaming is now available for ``win_shell` and
    ``win_command`` tasks on Windows hosts.

    Due to the addition of live console log streaming for Windows
    hosts, one of the following is necessary:

      * Add the ``zuul_win_console:`` task to the first pre-run
        playbook in a base job for Windows hosts, and allow
        connections to port 19886 on the hosts.  This will allow for
        automatic live log streaming in the same manner as under Posix
        systems.

      * If the above is not practical on long-lived Windows hosts, set
        ``zuul_console_disabled: True`` for those hosts.  This will
        disable writing console output to spool files on the remote
        hosts which would otherwise not be deleted.

    Note that the Posix and Windows log streaming servers operate on
    different ports (19885 and 19886 respectively) in order to allow
    both to coexist on the same host.
