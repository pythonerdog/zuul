features:
  - |
    Gerrit pipeline triggers now support embedded require and reject
    filters in order to match.  Any conditions set for the pipeline in
    require or reject filters may also be set for event trigger
    filters.

    This can be used to construct pipelines which trigger based on
    certain events but only if certain other conditions are met.  It
    is distinct from pipeline requirements in that it only affects
    items that are directly enqueued whereas pipeline requirements
    affect dependencies as well.
  - |
    All Gerrit "requires" filters are now available as "reject"
    filters as well.
deprecations:
  - |
    The `require-approval` and `reject-approval` Gerrit trigger
    attributes are deprecated.  Use :attr:`pipeline.trigger.<gerrit
    source>.require` and :attr:`pipeline.trigger.<gerrit
    source>.reject` instead.
