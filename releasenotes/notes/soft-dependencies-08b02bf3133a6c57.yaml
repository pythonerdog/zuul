features:
  - The :attr:`job.dependencies` attribute may now be used to express
    "soft" dependencies -- that is, to indicate a job should run
    after another completes, but only if it runs at all.  For example,
    a deployment job which should always run, but depends on a build
    job which only runs if the source code is changed.
