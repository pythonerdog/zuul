    If sensitive data must be returned from a job in order to be
    provided to dependent jobs, the ``secret_data`` attribute of
    ``zuul_return`` attribute may now be used instead of the normal
    ``data`` attribute.  The data will be provided via the same
    mechanism as job secrets, where the data are not written to disk
    in the work directory.  Care must still be taken to avoid
    displaying or storing sensitive data within the job.  For example:
    
    .. code-block:: yaml
    
      tasks:
        - zuul_return:
            secret_data:
              password: foobar
            data:
              this_is: not secret
