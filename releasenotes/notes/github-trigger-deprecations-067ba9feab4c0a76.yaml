deprecations:
  - |
    Specifying :attr:`pipeline.trigger.<github source>.event` as a
    list is deprecated.  Update any instances to specify multiple
    triggers each with a single associated event instead.
  - |
    The use of :value:`pipeline.trigger.<github
    source>.action.requested` has been deprecated for some time
    already.  Its use will now produce a configuration syntax warning,
    and in a future version of Zuul, an error.
  - |
    The use of :attr:`pipeline.trigger.<github source>.require-status`
    has been deprecated for some already.  Its use will now produce a
    configuration syntax warning, and in a future version of Zuul, an
    error.
