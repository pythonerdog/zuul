    The builds/ and buildset/ API endpoints now include information about
    retried builds. They are called non-final as those are all builds that
    were retried at least once and thus weren't visible to the user so far.

    The builds/ API can filter those retried builds and you might exclude
    them from API result by setting ``final=false`` in the API request.
