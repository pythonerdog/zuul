    The new variable :var:`zuul.playbook_context` as well as new
    variables under :var:`zuul.projects` have been added to help debug
    or audit the playbooks and roles used by Ansible when running
    jobs.

    These variables describe the repo configuration used for the
    playbooks and roles of each Ansible execution.  These repos may
    have a different state than the workspace repos.
