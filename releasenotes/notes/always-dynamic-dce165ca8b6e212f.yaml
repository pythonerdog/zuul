    Added a new
    :attr:`tenant.untrusted-projects.<project>.always-dynamic-branches`
    tenant project configuration option.  This may be used to specify
    branches from which Zuul should never load static configuration
    and instead treat every change as if it newly proposed dynamic
    configuration.  This is potentially useful for large numbers of
    rarely-used feature branches.
