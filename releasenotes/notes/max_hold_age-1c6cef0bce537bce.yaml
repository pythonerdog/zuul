    New scheduler options, max_hold_expiration and default_hold_expiration, are
    added to control how long nodes held for an autohold request remain
    available. The max_hold_expiration option defaults to 0, which means the
    held nodes will not automatically expire, and default_hold_expiration
    defaults to the value of max_hold_expiration.
