    Zuul recently added the job variable :var:`zuul.message`. This can contain
    jinja tags which can cause problems accessing the zuul variable in the job.
    Because of this the message is now base64 encoded and any job evaluating
    this variable needs to be changed from ``{{ zuul.message }}`` to
    ``{{ zuul.message | b64decode }}``.
