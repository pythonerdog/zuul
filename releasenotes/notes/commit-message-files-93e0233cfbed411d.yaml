    The pseudo-file "/COMMIT_MSG" is not considered at all when
    determining whether a change matches files or irrelevant-files
    matchers.  It was previously not considered in most cases, but in
    the case of a negated regular expression in an irrelevant-files
    stanza, it could still have an effect.  This has been corrected
    and any regexes that explicitly mention "/COMMIT_MSG" may remove
    it.
