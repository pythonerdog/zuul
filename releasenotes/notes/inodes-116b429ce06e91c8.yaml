    The executor now monitors filesystem inode usage as well as
    storage usage.  The threshold for accepting jobs can be configured
    independenty with :attr:`executor.min_avail_inodes`.  Inode
    usage is also reported separately with the
    :stat:`zuul.executor.<executor>.pct_used_inodes` metric.
