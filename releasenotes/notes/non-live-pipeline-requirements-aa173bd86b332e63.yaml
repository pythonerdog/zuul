    A new pipeline attribute,
    :attr:`pipeline.allow-other-connections`, has been added
    to ensure that only changes from connections which
    are mentioned in the pipeline configuration (such as triggers,
    reporters, or pipeline requirements) are enqueued.

    Non-live items are now subject to pipeline requirements for
    independent pipelines.

    Previously, an optimization for independent pipelines skipped
    checking that a change met the pipeline requirements.  If an
    independent pipeline is intended only to run reviewed code, this
    could allow running unreviewed code by updating dependent changes.

    Now both non-live and live items are subject to pipeline
    requirements in all pipeline managers.

    The new `allow-other-connections` pipeline configuration option
    may now be used to ensure that only changes from connections which
    are mentioned in the pipeline configuration (such as triggers,
    reporters, or pipeline requirements) are enqueued.  This allows
    the construction of a pipeline where, for example, code review
    requirements are strictly enforced, even for dependencies which
    are not normally directly enqueued.
