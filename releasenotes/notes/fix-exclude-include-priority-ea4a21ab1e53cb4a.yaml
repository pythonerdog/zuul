    Fixes `tenant.untrusted-projects.<project>.include-branches` being lower
    priority than `tenant.untrusted-projects.<project>.exclude-branches` to
    match the documentation and expected user behavior.

    This only affects projects that are using both `include-branches` and
    `exclude-branches` at the same time. Now, `include-branches` has priority
    over `exclude-branches` for any branches that match both. Practically
    speaking, this means that `exclude-branches` is ignored if
    `include-branches` is set.
