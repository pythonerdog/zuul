deprecations:
  - |
    Zuul now correctly handles the ``rerequested`` action on check run trigger
    definitions (:value:`pipeline.trigger.<github source>.event.check_run`)
    literally. This has been ``requested`` which doesn't match the GitHub api.
    The value ``requested`` is now deprecated and will be removed in a later
    release.
