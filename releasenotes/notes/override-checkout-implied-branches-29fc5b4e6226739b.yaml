    The use of implied branch matchers in jobs where
    `override-checkout` was specified could cause some jobs to include
    unintended variants.  Specifically: job variants with implied
    branch matchers on branches which are substring matches of a
    branch specified in the `override-checkout` job attribute may have
    been used when not intended.

    This has been corrected so that the same job variant matching
    process happens whether the change's branch or the branch
    specified by override-checkout is used.
