    The `zuul-admin prune-database` command did not completely delete
    expected data from the database.  It may not have deleted all of
    the buildsets older than the specified cutoff time, and it may
    have left orphaned data in ancillary tables.  This has been
    corrected and it should now work as expected.  Additionally, a
    `--batch-size` argument has been added so that it may delete data
    in multiple transactions which can facilitate smoother operation
    when run while Zuul is operational.

    Users who have previously run the command may need to manually
    delete rows from the `zuul_build`, `zuul_build_event`,
    `zuul_artifact`, and `zuul_provides` tables which do not have
    corresponding entries in the `zuul_buildset` table.
