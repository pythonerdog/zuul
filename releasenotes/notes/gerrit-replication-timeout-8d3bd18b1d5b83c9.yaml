    Add replication_timeout to Gerrit connection configuration. Setting
    this to a positive value makes Zuul's Gerrit connection replication
    aware. Zuul will wait up to this many seconds for replication to
    complete for events like patchset-created, change-merged, and
    ref-updated before continuing to process those primary events.
    This is useful if you have configured Zuul to look at a Gerrit
    replica for git data.
