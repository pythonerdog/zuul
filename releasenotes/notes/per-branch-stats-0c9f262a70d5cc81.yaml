    Monitoring stats for per-branch queues are now distinct from
    shared-branch queues.  Shared branch queue stats are at:

      :stat:`zuul.tenant.<tenant>.pipeline.<pipeline>.queue`.

    Per-branch queue stats are now at:

      :stat:`zuul.tenant.<tenant>.pipeline.<pipeline>.queue.<queue>.branch`.

    Prior to this change, per-branch queue stats for one branch queue
    may have overwritten the stats from another queue resulting in
    incomplete or incorrect data.
