    Additional syntax checking is performed on job configuration
    changes so that Zuul will report an error if a job inherits from a
    non-permitted parent (such as a final job, intermediate job when
    the child is not abstract, or a protected job in another project).
    Previously, these situations might only be discovered when
    freezing a job graph.

    If any jobs currently in this situation exist, they will be
    reported as configuration errors.
