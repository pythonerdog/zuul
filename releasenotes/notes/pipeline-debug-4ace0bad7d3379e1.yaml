    Most pipeline triggers now accept a ``debug`` attribute which may
    be used to add a trigger to allow users to request extra debug
    information about why a change may or may not have been enqueued
    into a pipeline and why certain jobs ran or did not run.

    For example, a site may add a trigger that matches the comment
    "check debug" to request an expanded report on a change.
