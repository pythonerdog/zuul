    If a change alters a file in an :attr:`job.include-vars`,
    :attr:`job.pre-run`, :attr:`job.run`, or :attr:`job.post-run`
    attribute of a job, then that job will run regardless of any file
    matchers configured on the job (unless
    :attr:`job.match-on-config-updates` is disabled).

    This means that jobs with file matchers should no longer need to
    explicitly list their playbooks or include-vars files in order to
    run on changes to those files.
