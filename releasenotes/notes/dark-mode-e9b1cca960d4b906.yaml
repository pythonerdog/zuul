    Added a new dark theme for the Zuul web interface.

    Added theme selection for the Zuul web interface. The default theme is set
    to Auto which means your system/browsers preference determines if the Light
    or Dark theme should be used. Either can be explicitly set in the settings
    for the web interface by clicking the cogs in the top right.
