    In 10.0.0, supercedent pipelines could raise exceptions when
    enqueing changes that were part of a dependency cycle (regardless
    of whether the changes merged or not).  This has been corrected,
    and the documentation has been updated to clarify that circular
    dependencies are ignored in supercedent pipelines.
