    Jobs may now read variables from an in-repo file using the
    :attr:`job.include-vars` job attribute.  This allows jobs with
    many (or frequently changing) variables to load their variables
    from a file in order to reduce the complexity of Zuul
    configuration.  Because these files are read when the job is
    executed, changes to their values will not cause Zuul tenant
    reconfigurations.
