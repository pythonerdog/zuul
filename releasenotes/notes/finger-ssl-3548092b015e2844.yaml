    The finger gateway and executor log streaming system now supports TLS
    connections.

    Normally zuul-web makes a direct connection to an executor in
    order to stream logs.  With this new option, that connection can
    be encrypted if it crosses an untrusted network.

    The ability to route log streaming connections through finger
    gateway servers was recently added; these will also use TLS if
    required.

    The finger gateway server can also be used by end-users; in that
    case it may need a TLS certificate to use if it is required to
    connect to an encrypted executor or finger gateway to stream logs.
    An option to disable using TLS when acting as a server is provided
    for this case, since there are no TLS-enable finger clients.

    See :attr:`fingergw.tls_cert` and related options to enable
    encrypted connections for all three components.
