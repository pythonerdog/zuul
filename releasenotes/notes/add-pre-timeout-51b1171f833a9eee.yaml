features:
  - |
    Jobs now have the ability to set a :attr:`job.pre-timeout` value. This
    timeout limits the amount of time that pre-run playbooks may consume.
    This timeout counts against the normal :attr:`job.timeout` value and if
    :attr:`job.pre-timeout` is unset then :attr:`job.timeout` is used.
fixes:
  - |
    Job json API responses now include the :attr:`job.post-timeout`
    configuration value for the job.
