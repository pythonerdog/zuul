    An option to use the URL of the Zuul build page when reporting has
    been added.  This feature requires that all the pipelines in the
    tenant have a SQL reporter configured, and at
    least one of :attr:`tenant.web-root` or :attr:`web.root` must be
    defined.

    See ``tenant.report-build-page``.

  - |
    As further integration with the web interface is planned, the
    :attr:`web.root` setting in ``zuul.conf`` is marked required and
    future releases may error if it is missing.  Please add it to your
    configuration now.  See :attr:`tenant.web-root` for additional
    information about whitelabel tenants.
