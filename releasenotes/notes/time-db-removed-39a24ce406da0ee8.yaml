    The scheduler time database has been removed.  This was stored in
    the scheduler state directory, typically ``/var/lib/zuul/times``.
    The entire state directory on the scheduler is no longer used and
    may now be removed.

    Zuul now derives its estimated build duration times from the SQL
    database.
