    Several job attributes may now have their inheritance behavior
    changed through "override control".  This introduces two new YAML
    tags, ``!override`` and ``!inherit`` which may be used to
    explicitly specify whether certain job attributes should inherit
    values from parent jobs or override them.

    See the general job documentation at :ref:`job` and also
    documentation for the following individual attributes:

      * :attr:`job.dependencies`
      * :attr:`job.extra-vars`
      * :attr:`job.failure-output`
      * :attr:`job.files`
      * :attr:`job.group-vars`
      * :attr:`job.host-vars`
      * :attr:`job.irrelevant-files`
      * :attr:`job.provides`
      * :attr:`job.required-projects`
      * :attr:`job.requires`
      * :attr:`job.tags`
      * :attr:`job.vars`

    The zuul_return Ansible plugin will now validate the schema of the
    data supplied to it; particularly the data for warnings and
    artifacts.  Previously the behavior on incorrectly structured data
    was undefined and ranged from being silently ignorred to causing
    exceptions in pipeline processing.  Data format errors will now be
    detected while the job is running and will cause Ansible errors
    and (if not ignored) job failures.
