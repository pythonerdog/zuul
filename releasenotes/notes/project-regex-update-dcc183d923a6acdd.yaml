    Project name regex handling has been updated to return all possible
    matches. Previously if there were collisions with short names it was an
    error. The point of the regex system is to simplify configuration and
    apply configs to all projects that match. Collisions don't impact this
    behavior so we don't need to raise an error in these cases.
