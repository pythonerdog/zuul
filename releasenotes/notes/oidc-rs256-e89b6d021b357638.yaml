    Added support for OpenID Connect (OIDC) compatible workload
    identity federation.  When configured using :attr:`secret.oidc`,
    Zuul will generate an OIDC ID token and supply it to the job,
    which can be used to authenticate to external services that trust
    Zuul as an OIDC Identity Provider.  See :ref:`secret` for more
    information.
