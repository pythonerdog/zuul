    An option has been added to allow multiple timer-triggered queue
    items for the same project-branch may now be enqueued if the
    branch head has advanced.

    Previously timer-triggered items only included information about
    the project and branch, and therefore if a job on such an item ran
    longer than the timer interval, Zuul would not enqueue a second
    copy of the item because it would have been seen as identical to
    the first (even if the underlying repo had changed.

    If the new ``dereference`` attribute of the timer trigger is set,
    Zuul will now include information about the branch head SHA of the
    queue item, so that now if a timer trigger fires while a queue
    item for the same project-branch is already in the queue, the
    second item will be enqueued if the branch has changed since the
    first item was enqueued.  If the SHA of the branch head is the
    same for both items, the second item will not be enqueued.

    When set, the ``newrev`` is now available in the job's ``zuul``
    variables for such queue items.

    The previous behavior remains the default, where derefence is not
    set, and ``newrev`` is not available.
