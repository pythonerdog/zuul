features:
  - |
    Information about all of the changes (refs) associated with a
    circular dependency queue item is now available in the
    :var:`zuul.buildset_refs` variable.
fixes:
  - |
    The value of :var:`zuul.items.project.src_dir` did not take into
    account the job's workspace scheme and was always constructed
    using the golang scheme.  That has been corrected so that it now
    reflects the job's scheme.
