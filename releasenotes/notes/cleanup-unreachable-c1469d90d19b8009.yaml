    The recent security fix to run cleanup-run playbooks interleaved
    with post-run playbooks incorrectly caused jobs to retry if a
    cleanup playbook encountered an unreachable host.  This has been
    corrected and a cleanup playbook will never cause a job to retry
    if it encounters an unreachable host.
