  This is a checkpoint release.  This release contains some bugfixes
  and other user-invisible changes, but its main purpose is to serve
  as a checkpoint as we move more of Zuul's functionality into
  ZooKeeper.  This version has seen production use in OpenDev and we
  believe it to be stable and ready for wider use.  Please do upgrade
  to it and report any issues to zuul-discuss.  You may downgrade to
  the previous release if you do encounter any issues.  Likewise,
  operators running the latest development builds may downgrade to
  this release in the case of issues.
