    A new job variable, `zuul.commit_id` has been added.  This
    provides a stable identifier for all types of pipeline queue items
    (changes, refs, tags, or branches) from any driver to identify the
    commit which triggered the queue item.  This can be used to
    interface with external systems which identify changes by commit.
