    The ansible version to use can now be specified by
    :attr:`job.ansible-version`.

    In order to support several ansible versions installed simultaneously
    Zuul now handles them itself in virtual environments. By default Zuul
    installs the needed ansible versions on startup so there is no further
    user action required. However it is recommended to pre-install the
    ansible environments during installation by invoking
    ``zuul-manage-ansible``.
