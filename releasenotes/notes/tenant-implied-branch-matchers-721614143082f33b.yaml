    A new tenant project configuration option,
    `implied-branch-matchers` has been added.  This is useful in
    conjunction with the branch exclusion options which may cause Zuul
    to change behavior as the set of load branches switches between
    one and more than one.  The operator can fix the appropriate
    behavior in the tenant config file rather than relying on the
    heuristic in these cases.
