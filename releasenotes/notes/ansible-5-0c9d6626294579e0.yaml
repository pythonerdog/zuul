    Ansible version 5 is now available.  The default Ansible version
    is still 2.9, but version 5 may be selected by using
    :attr:`job.ansible-version`.

upgrade:
  - |
    This is the first version of Ansible added to Zuul since the
    Ansible project began releasing the `Ansible community` package.
    Zuul includes the Ansible community package since it includes a
    wide selection of useful modules, many of which were included by
    default in previous versions of Ansible.

    Only the major version of Ansible community is specified
    (e.g. ``ansible-version: 5``).  This corresponds to a single minor
    release of Ansible core (e.g., Ansible community 5 corresponds to
    Ansible core 2.12).  Ansible releases minor versions of the
    community package which may contain updates to the included
    Ansible collections as well as micro version updates of Ansible
    core (e.g. Ansible community 5.6 includes ansible-core 2.12.4).

    Zuul does not specify the minor version of Ansible community,
    therefore the latest available micro-version will be installed at
    build-time.  If you need more control over the version of Ansible
    used, see the help text for ``zuul-manage-ansible``.

    Python 3.8 or newer is required to run Zuul. This change was necessary
    to support Ansible 5 and newer as Ansible's minimum python requirement
    is 3.8.
