features:
  - |
    The executor now honors the :attr:`executor.sigterm_method`
    configuration file setting to determine whether ``SIGTERM`` should be
    equivalent to the ``graceful`` command (the default) or the
    ``stop`` command.
upgrade:
  - |
    The default behavior when an executor receives SIGTERM has been
    changed from immediately stopping jobs to gracefully waiting for
    them to finish.  Set the :attr:`executor.sigterm_method`
    configuration file setting to ``stop`` to preserve the old behavior.
