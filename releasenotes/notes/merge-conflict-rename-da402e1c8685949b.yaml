upgrade:
  - |
    The buildset result ``MERGER_FAILURE`` has been renamed to
    ``MERGE_CONFLICT``, and the pipeline reporter configuration
    ``merge-failure`` has been renamed to ``merge-conflict``.

    These are more descriptive of the most common errors actually
    reported, and so are expected to be less confusing to users.  This
    is also in service of a future change to support a new buildset
    result ``MERGE_FAILURE`` which will indicate that the change was
    unable to be merged in the upstream repository.

    When upgrading, it is recommended to stop all schedulers briefly
    (i.e, when the first scheduler of the new version starts, there
    should be no schedulers running the old version).  The new
    scheduler will perform a database migration when it starts and
    update all existing ``MERGER_FAILURE`` buildset results to
    ``MERGE_CONFLICT``.  If old schedulers are running, they may
    continue to add ``MERGER_FAILURE`` entries which will need to be
    manually updated in order to be visible in the web UI or rest API.

deprecations:
  - |
    The ``merge-failure`` and ``merge-failure-message`` pipeline
    configuration options have been renamed to ``merge-conflict`` and
    ``merge-conflict-message`` respectively.  The old settings are
    retained for backwards compatibility, but will be removed in a
    later version.  Please update your usage of them as soon as
    possible.
