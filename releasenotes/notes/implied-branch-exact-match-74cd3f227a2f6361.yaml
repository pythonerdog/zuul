    Projects and jobs on branches whose names have special characters
    in regular expressions could fail to match changes as intended.
    Implied branch matchers automatically generated from branch names
    are now treated as requiring exact matches.  Any user-specified
    branch matcher (including in :attr:`job.branches` and
    :attr:`pragma.implied-branches`) are still treated as regular
    expressions.
