    Two new settings are available to protect Zuul from resource
    exhaustion from processing too many dependencies among changes.
    The Gerrit driver supports setting :attr:`<gerrit
    connection>.max_dependencies` to limit internal dependency
    processing during event processing, and a new tenant setting of
    :attr:`tenant.max-dependencies` is available to limit tenant
    processing while enqueing changes in pipelines.
