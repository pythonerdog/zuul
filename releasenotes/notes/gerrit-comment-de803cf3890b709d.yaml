    The Gerrit driver now has an additional option,
    :attr:`pipeline.reporter.<gerrit reporter>.comment` which may be
    used to suppress reporting job results as review comments.  Due to
    the configuration syntax for Gerrit reporters, the word "comment"
    may no longer be used as a review label.
