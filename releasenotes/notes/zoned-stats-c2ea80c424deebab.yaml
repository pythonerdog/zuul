    Two sets of statsd metrics are now reported for executors: zoned
    and unzoned.  The existing statsd keys are now deprecated; new
    statsd keys are available for both zoned and unzoned executors.
    See :stat:`zuul.executors` for details.

    If zoned executors were used with prior releases of Zuul, the
    reported executor statistics would only represent a single,
    unspecified zone.  This has now been corrected.
