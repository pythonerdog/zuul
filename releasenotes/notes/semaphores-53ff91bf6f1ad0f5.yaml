    Jobs may now request multiple semaphores and they will not start until
    all semaphores are acquired.

    Use the new :attr:`job.semaphores` (plural) attribute to specify them.

    Note that the new attribute is additive when considering
    inheritance and job variants.  That is to say that a job
    definition with a `semaphores` attribute will extend the list of
    semaphores supplied by its parent rather than overriding it (which
    is the behavior for the deprecated attribute).
deprecations:
  - |
    The job attribute :attr:`job.semaphore` (note the singular rather
    than plural form) job attribute is now deprecated.  Use the plural
    form :attr:`job.semaphores` instead.  As with most list items in
    Zuul configuration, it also accepts a single item without the
    wrapping list, so to convert existing jobs, simply change the
    spelling of the attribute, no change to the value is required.

    The singular form will be removed in Zuul 5.0.
