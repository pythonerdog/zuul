    Added new tenant project configuration options
    attr:`tenant.untrusted-projects.<project>.include-branches` and
    attr:`tenant.untrusted-projects.<project>.exclude-branches`.
    Similar to *exclude-unprotected-branches*, these may be used to
    reduce the set of branches from which Zuul will load
    configuration.
