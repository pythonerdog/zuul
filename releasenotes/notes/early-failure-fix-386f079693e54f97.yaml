    Ansible task failures in block/rescue stanzas could cause Zuul to
    erroneously trigger early-failure behavior for the build, which
    could result in inconsistent behavior in a dependent pipeline.
    Task failures in Ansible blocks are no longer considered for early
    failure detection, and if a build encounters an early failure, it
    will cause the build result to be reported as a failure in all
    cases.
