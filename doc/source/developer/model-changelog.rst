Data Model Changelog
====================

Record changes to the ZooKeeper data model which require API version
increases here.

When making a model change:

* Increment the value of ``MODEL_API`` in ``model_api.py``.
* Update code to use the new API by default and add
  backwards-compatibility handling for older versions.  This makes it
  easier to clean up backwards-compatibility handling in the future.
* Make sure code that special cases model versions either references a
  ``model_api`` variable or has a comment like `MODEL_API: >
  {version}` so that we can grep for that and clean up compatibility
  code that is no longer needed.
* Add a test to ``test_model_upgrade.py``.
* Add an entry to this log so we can decide when to remove
  backwards-compatibility handlers.
