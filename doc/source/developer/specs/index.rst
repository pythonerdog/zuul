Specifications
==============

This section contains specifications for future Zuul development.  As
we work on implementing significant changes, these document our plans
for those changes and help us work on them collaboratively. Once a
specification is implemented, it should be removed. All relevant
details for implemented work must be reflected correctly in Zuul's
documentation instead.

.. warning:: These are not authoritative documentation.  These
   features are not currently available in Zuul.  They may change
   significantly before final implementation, or may never be fully
   completed.
